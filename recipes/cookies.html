    <h6>A perfectly soft chocolate chip cookie</h6>

      These cookies are so soft and delicious. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>16 tablespoon of salted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup raw cane sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40
        seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be
        almost entirely in liquid form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars
        until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just
        incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long,
        the cookies will be stiff).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your
        hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one
        large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet”
        dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with
        your hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and
        place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look
        puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE.
        This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but
        this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if
        they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll
        be pale and puffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat
        four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down
        and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in
        all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an
        airtight container. I also like to freeze them.
